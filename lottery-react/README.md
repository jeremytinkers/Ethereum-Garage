# lottery-react-app

A rudimentary Lottery app in React, built on top of the ethereum framework. 

- Metamask is required to run this app. (Since a local instance of web3 is created with access to the Metamask provider for a user's accounts) 

- Before running this app, ensure that the Lottery smart contract (from ../lotteryContract) has been pre deployed and the  appropriate ABI & address of the smart contract has been passed along.

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
